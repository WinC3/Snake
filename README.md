My very first try at making an actual game!

Obviously the Snake game is very well known and can be made without too much difficulty, 
but this is my entry project into trying to develop more complicated applications.

I originally thought this wouldn't take too long, but I did get stuck multiple times, and thus 
had to do research at length just to resolve a few simple issues.

As a first project, I made it rather minimalistic because my main goal was to develop 
some familiarity with the development process. I suceeded in doing so if I were to say so myself.

To whomever this may concern, please enjoy my recreation of a game you are all too familiar with.
